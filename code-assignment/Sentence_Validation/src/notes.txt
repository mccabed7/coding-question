#Running time
Best case performance:
    O(1) (for example if a sentence doesn't have a capital letter)

Worst case performance:
    O(a * b) = O(n)
    a = amount of words
    b = average word length
    n = length of sentence
    It loops through each word in the sentence, and goes through each letter of the words
    This equals to going through each character in the sentence once
    => O(n) performance
